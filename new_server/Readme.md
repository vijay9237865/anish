all our code is in python_code folder

# just run app.py alone

you will get 2 outputs

1. output_final.csv
2. text files from the images

(note: you have to change the folder path in pipeline.py alone)

remaining all are relative paths, so no need to change those

run server on: http://127.0.0.1:5000/run-pipeline
